**SE450 Software Testing Project**

The binary search tree code was developed by ChatGPT and myself! I had personal projects that were too large in size to generate tests for and most open-source projects are even larger. 

Additionally, I had various issues with AFL++ so I thought I would create a clean slate and try out TSTL, which resulted with better data in general.

Thanks!
